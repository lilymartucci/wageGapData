# UK Wage Gap Data Analysis 

Blah blah blah.

## Introduction

a) As a young woman, the gender pay gap is particularly of intererst to me because it places me and other women at a disadvantage. Additionally, as a woman 
interested in finance, the industry with the greatest gender pay gap, I wanted to dive deeper and know more. Although the data is from the UK, it is a modern country that is similar to the United States.
Most jobs that can be done in the US, are available to do in the UK as well. Because this data is so recent, it is very relevant to this issue. 

b) I attempted to answer two questions. Is there a difference in the percent of female and male employees that receives a bonus ? Is there a greater percent of men or women in the top hourly pay quarter?

If I had extra time I wanted to look at how company size affects this data.

## Methods

(a) Dataset. Describe what you know about how the data was generated. If possibly, include information about who owns the dataset and why you are able to use it.
(b) Process. How did you go about answering your questions? What specific pieces of information did you need from your data set and how did you combine data to arrive at your answer?
(c) Challenges. Did you run into any difficulties? If so, how did you approach solving them?

## Results and Conclusion

(a) What did the data show? What are your takeaways? Plots might be helpful, depending on your question.
(b) What are some related or additional questions that you would explore if you had more time and resources (e.g. other datasets, additional Java data analysis libraries)
